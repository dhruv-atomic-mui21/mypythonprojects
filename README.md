## How to Use

- Each project is a standalone Python script.
- Some projects require external libraries such as `requests`, `matplotlib`, or `flask`. Install them using pip if needed:
  ```
  pip install requests matplotlib flask
  ```
- Run the scripts using Python 3:
  ```
  python filename.py
  ```
- For GUI applications, a window will open for interaction.
- For console applications, follow the on-screen prompts.

## Notes

- Replace API keys where necessary (e.g., in the weather app).
- Ensure internet connectivity for apps that require API access.
- Feel free to modify and expand the projects to enhance your learning.
